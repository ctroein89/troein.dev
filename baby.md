# Buying Guide for Babies

This is a summary of what I learnt when doing research when my daughter was born, and is written from a dad's perspective. For reading this, remember 3 ideas:
1. This guide reflects my research at the time that I did it, and new information may impact my recommendations.
2. This guide is written to work for both a New York City walk-up and an elevator apartment building, and may not work for a different lifestyle.
3. Weight is going to be a problem - Mom is going to be recovering from the pregnancy, and grandparents may not have the stregth to begin with

## Car Seat
Your baby should not stay in a car seat for longer than [2 hours per day according to the NHS](https://elht.nhs.uk/services/maternity-and-newborn-services/keeping-your-baby-safe#:~:text=Your%20baby%20should%20not%20be,at%20least%20every%20two%20hours). Therefore, the car seat is only to be temporarily used when traveling. Therefore, don't buy a car seat-stroller like the Doona Plus Car Seat: as far as I can tell, it's solving the wrong set of problems.

[Baby Gear Lab ran crash tests on infant seats](https://www.babygearlab.com/topics/vehicle-safety/best-infant-car-seat). The goal is to have the impact of the crash to be spread over the longest period of time. But, that crash test data assumes that the baby is properly positioned within their car seat. In order to ensure that the baby is properly positioned, the car seat has to be comfortable for the baby, which in turn means that the safest car seat needs to balance deceleration with some comfort.

The foam in baby car seats have an expiration date. Never use a car seat that's been involved in a moderate or serious crash (and think twice about "light" crashes), and don't accept old old hand-me-downs (practically new is okay). Car seats are about safety, and never cut costs with safety.

The guidance that I've read says to keep babies facing backwards for as long as possible. Their weight will be the primary determinant for when you have to change position and car seat, but a tall baby may outgrow their current seat. At the time that I was doing my research, the best guidance from the US government was to follow whatever the latest guidance from Sweden was.

### LATCH
The safest way to install a car seat is with the [LATCH system](https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/0625/): basically all modern cars have LATCH attachment points. The goal of the LATCH system is to ensure that all cars have a standardized and easy method for installing car seats. The standard configuration is for cars to support 2 car seats at the same time, but some cars support 3 car seats next to each other.

Be sure to look at the dimensions of your car before choosing a LATCH car seat: some cars will claim 3 LATCH attachement points, but aren't wide enough to accomodate 3 regular-width car seats (and some car seats with claim support for 3-abreast seating, without being any narrower). However, don't pre-emptively buy narrower car seats, since wider car seats can provide better padding in the event of a side collision (or may simply fit a fatter baby).

Most car seats integrate into the LATCH system via a heavy base. If you only drive your car, the base ensures that the car seat is as light as possible, while still getting the benefits of LATCH. For a baby taken via taxi or Uber to doctor's appointments, the car seat should ideally have the LATCH system integrated into the car seat.

I've settled on the [Nuna Urbn Flex system](https://nunababy.com/usa/pipa-urbn-flex-system?color_ref=16366) as my preferred car seat, because it has the LATCH system built into the car seat and since Nuna makes generally safe and comfortable car seat. The Nuna Urbn must be purchased as part of a bundle (along with a stroller), which is why I didn't initially find it when I was looking for a baby car seat.

The [Joie Mint Latch](https://joiebaby.com/us/mint-latch-integrated-rigid-latch#color=683) has been recommended to me for similar reasons.

### Belt routing
If you can't get a car seat with an integrated LATCH system in the seat, be aware of belt routing options. Belt routing refers to the path that the seatbelt takes around the car seat to secure it.

"European belt routing" refers to when the seat belt goes behind (from the baby's perspective) the car seat, which is generally safer in the event of a crash. The alternative (I assume "American belt routing") is that the seat belt exclusively over the lap of the infant. I picked the [Nuna Pipa rx + Pipa Relx Base](https://nunababy.com/usa/pipa-rx-infant-car-seat-with-relx-base) for this reason (partially because I wasn't aware of the Nuna Urbn).

### Weight and Size
For an infant car seat, favor a lighter seat, so that you can secure your baby into the car seat before putting the car seat into the car. Installing a newborn into a car seat is hard enough, so don't over complicate it by having to contort to fit into the backseat of the car at the same time.

With the same thinking, look for a car seat that attaches to a stroller, instead of car seat that converts into a stroller. That's bulk (both weight and size) that you don't want to be lifting into the car at the same time as you are trying to put your baby in.

When your child outgrows the infant car seat, the car seats will require being installed first. At this point, I think a heavier convertable car seat is fine.

When flying, you'll go back to wanting the lightest car seat available, since you will be carrying it. The [Cosco Kids Scenera from Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/CK-SCENERA-CC-SIP-NT/9321554473) is a perfectly fine choice.

## Stroller
The car seat will inform one of the strollers that you should pick. If you bought the Nuna Urbn bundle, part of the stroller decision making is already done for you.

Most stroller brands are interoperateable with car seats from other brands when used with the right adapters, but double-check the attachment compatability before you buy.

As your baby grows, the stroller requirements are going to change. My baby was born in the winter, so she only went outside to go to the neighborhood peadatrician in an Uber. Now that she's older and the weather is warmer, we walk almost everywhere with her, using the stroller as a cargo carrier.

### Weight, Suspension and Folded Carrying
A light weight stroller is easier to lift, but a heavy stroller provides a more comfortable ride for your baby.

For picking a "light" stroller, try picking it up once folded. In my experience, that's when a stroller is most difficult to carry, and when weight becomes most apparent. To make an analogy, the folded stroller works like a kettlebell, trying to pull you out of balance.

However, a heavy stroller will have more inertia, and therefore be a more comfortable ride. The suspension seems to work better when the stroller has more mass.

We started with a 17lb travel stroller, which worked great for carrying it up and down the stairs in our our walk-up apartment. But when we went outside of our immediate area, it became very clear that the stroller's suspension as insufficient for the state the of the sidewalks we were walking over. And when we moved to an elevator building, we mostly stopped using the lightweight stroller.

### Folding mechanism
One-handed, three-part folding is amazing. Being able to hold your child with 1 hand, and fold the stroller with another, is great. But to make that truely work, you need the stroller to fold into thirds, so that the stroller handle is still in the air (ie, you don't have to bend to the ground to complete the fold). 

Two-part folder kinda sucks, especially if it needs two hands to do so. A stroller like this will basically assume that you live in an elevator building, and don't fold your stroller.

### Size
I recommend having a double stroller, even for one child, provided the seats are arranged in-line with the direction of the stroller (as opposed to having the seats side-by-side). The reason why is adding attachments for the baby car seat, so that the car seat is attached to the stroller while the baby is sitting comfortably in the main seat. The handful of times where we did this, it was super helpful (although, it also looks extremely goofy).

### Attachments and Cup Holders
I recommend buying a bunch of attachments for the stroller, especially cupholders. It sounds absurd, but 3 cupholders is the minimum that I would recommend. Every cupholder or stroller bag that you add will get filled up with stuff. Before you know it, you have 5 cups holders and you're still stuck carrying a cup.

Importantly, cargo capacity is a big factor in using a stroller. Our Vista is basically always full of empty tote bags, extra blankets and a baby carrier. It's the shopping cart when walking home from the grocery store. A bigger cargo capacity is better.

### What I Bought
I recommend the [Uppababy Minu](https://uppababy.com/strollers/lightweight/minu-v3/) and the [Uppababy Vista](https://uppababy.com/strollers/full-size/vista-v3/).

The Minu is basically the best travel stroller. It's light, and has a one-handed, three-part fold. If the suspension was better and the cargo capacity was bigger, I would have been tempted to not buying another stroller.

The Vista is perfect as long as you don't need to fold it or lift it up. The suspension is good, but cargo capacity is phenominal. The seating is great, and it's large enough that we could attach the car seat as an extra seat. Our Vista never gets folded up, which is a consideration for space.

## Feeding
### Formula
If you have a formula-fed baby, you must [mix the formula by boiling water, letting that cool to 70C, then mixing the formula powder, and then letting that cool to 40C before baby can drink it](https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/formula-feeding/preparation-and-storage.html) ([The FDA gives different advice on proper formula mixing](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/handling-infant-formula-safely-what-you-need-know)). This has to be done to kill Cronobacter spores that might be dangerous to your newborn. Getting an electric kettle speeds up one part of this process. Get any electric kettle - this is your opportunity to buy that EKG Stagg kettle that you've always wanted.

[Mason jar pitchers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D25RRRKY) were the perfect solution for pre-mixing formula.

If you formula feed, buy the [Baby Brezza Baby Formula Dispenser](https://babybrezza.com/products/formula-pro-advanced-wifi-baby-formula-dispenser): if you have a formula-fed baby, and if your baby is old enough to have the stomach acids that allows them to skip the sterilization-mixing process, a formula dispenser is a god-send. It makes baby bottles almost instantly, and if you have the discipline to put in a new bottle when taking the filled one out, the wifi enabled model lets you fill a bottle as you're walking across the apartment.

If you formula-feed, keeping your formula-making area clean will be an important concern. Take a look at a bottle washer to keep everything as clean as possible.

### Bottles
I like the [Pigeon Bottles](https://www.pigeonstore.com/products/ppsu-wide-neck-baby-bottle-2), but my recommendation is to just buy lots and lots of different brands of bottles, and then use whichever one works.

"Anti-colic" features on bottles are basically a lie - doctors will say that the research says that colic has nothing to do with babies getting air into their stomaches while drinking milk or formula. Anti-colic features do help a baby drink from a bottle, but they do so via allowing air in via a route other than the center of the nipple. Anti-colic features also often take the form of straws or tubes inside the bottle - these are very annoying to clean, and the nipple collapses more easily if the full system isn't being used. I strongly prefer to avoid those bottle entirely if possible.

I found that holding baby semi-upright was necessary to minimize spit-up, at which point, it was sufficient for the bottle to have a side hole for air to enter the bottle.

Additionally, the recommendation was to prefer a slower-flowing nipple, and to only upgrade nipple sizes when it was becoming apparent that a bigger flow was necessary. Lot's of smaller bottles over the day was better than fewer big bottles.

Buy a bottle washer, not a sterilizer, like the [Baby Brezza Bottle Washer Pro](https://babybrezza.com/products/bottle-washer-pro). I bought a sterilizer, and did not know that the bottler washer existed until my baby's bottle could just go in the dish washer. You will be washing bottles multiple times per day, so having a separate appliance, where you can just leave clean bottles in them, is fully worth the cost. With the sterilizer, the bottle must be washed first, which means hand washed given the frequency at which bottles need to be cleaned. You could stick to using a dish washer with the sanitize setting, or not bothering, but the piece of mind from having clean and sterilized bottles is worth the cost. 

## Other
### Changing Pads
* Changing pad for on-the-go: [Skip Hop Changing Pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WDDBLM?th=1) - no padding, but can carry daipers, wipes and creams.
* At home changing pads - I've have not found the perfect changing pad, but the least bad one is [Keekaroo Peanut Changer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSW970Y).
  * I want one that gets attached to the table, and those don't seem to exist. Instead you can choose between if the strap is attached to the table or attached to the changing pad. If the strap is attached to the changing pad, baby can try to flip the changing pad off the table or drawer that it's on (which is not okay). If the strap is attached to the table, the changing pad will shift under the strap, which is slightly better, but still suboptimal.
  * You will be choosing between having a soft changing pad or having one that's easy to clean
 
### Crib
[Cribs are regulated](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1219). Read up on the latest safety standards for cribs, and then buy a crib accordingly. I bought the [Nestig Wave Crib](https://www.nestig.com/products/the-wave-crib), and it has been great for expandability as my baby grew.

Try renting a [SNOO Smart Sleeper](https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-rental). It's a smart crib that automatically shushes and rocks your baby, but requires that your baby is swaddled using their sleep sacks. It worked great for our baby, but not all babies love it in the same way. Therefore, rent instead of buy. The SNOO is based on the ideas in [The Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr Harvey Karp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553393235), and reading the book was helpful.
