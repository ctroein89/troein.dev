# Buying Guide for Babies

## Car Seat

Your baby should not stay in a car seat for longer than [2 hours per day according to the NHS](https://elht.nhs.uk/services/maternity-and-newborn-services/keeping-your-baby-safe#:~:text=Your%20baby%20should%20not%20be,at%20least%20every%20two%20hours). Therefore, the car seat is only to be temporarily used when traveling. Do not buy the Doona Plus Car Seat, it's the wrong solution to the wrong problem.

[Baby Gear Lab ran crash tests on infant seats](https://www.babygearlab.com/topics/vehicle-safety/best-infant-car-seat). The goal is to have the impact of the crash to be spread over the longest period of time. But, that crash test data assumes that the baby is properly positioned within their car seat. In order to ensure that the baby is properly positioned, the car seat has to be comfortable for the baby, which in turn means that the safest car seat needs to balance deceleration with some comfort.
