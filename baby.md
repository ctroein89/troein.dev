# Buying Guide for Babies

This is a summary of what I learnt when doing research when my daughter was born, and is written from a dad's perspective. For reading this, remember 3 ideas:
1. This guide reflects my research at the time that I did it, and new information may impact my recommendations.
2. This guide is written to work for both a New York City walk-up and an elevator apartment building, and may not work for a different lifestyle.
3. Weight is going to be a problem - Mom is going to be recovering from the pregnancy, and grandparents may not have the stregth to begin with

## Car Seat
Your baby should not stay in a car seat for longer than [2 hours per day according to the NHS](https://elht.nhs.uk/services/maternity-and-newborn-services/keeping-your-baby-safe#:~:text=Your%20baby%20should%20not%20be,at%20least%20every%20two%20hours). Therefore, the car seat is only to be temporarily used when traveling. Therefore, don't buy a car seat-stroller like the Doona Plus Car Seat: as far as I can tell, it's solving the wrong set of problems.

[Baby Gear Lab ran crash tests on infant seats](https://www.babygearlab.com/topics/vehicle-safety/best-infant-car-seat). The goal is to have the impact of the crash to be spread over the longest period of time. But, that crash test data assumes that the baby is properly positioned within their car seat. In order to ensure that the baby is properly positioned, the car seat has to be comfortable for the baby, which in turn means that the safest car seat needs to balance deceleration with some comfort.

The foam in baby car seats have an expiration date. Never use a car seat that's been involved in a moderate or serious crash (and think twice about "light" crashes), and don't accept old old hand-me-downs (practically new is okay). Car seats are about safety, and never cut costs with safety.

The guidance that I've read says to keep babies facing backwards for as long as possible. Their weight will be the primary determinant for when you have to change position and car seat, but a tall baby may outgrow their current seat. At the time that I was doing my research, the best guidance from the US government was to follow whatever the latest guidance from Sweden was.

### LATCH
The safest way to install a car seat is with the [LATCH system](https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/0625/): basically all modern cars have LATCH attachment points. The goal of the LATCH system is to ensure that all cars have a standardized and easy method for installing car seats. The standard configuration is for cars to support 2 car seats at the same time, but some cars support 3 car seats next to each other.

Be sure to look at the dimensions of your car before choosing a LATCH car seat: some cars will claim 3 LATCH attachement points, but aren't wide enough to accomodate 3 regular-width car seats (and some car seats with claim support for 3-abreast seating, without being any narrower). However, don't pre-emptively buy narrower car seats, since wider car seats can provide better padding in the event of a side collision (or may simply fit a fatter baby).

Most car seats integrate into the LATCH system via a heavy base. If you only drive your car, the base ensures that the car seat is as light as possible, while still getting the benefits of LATCH. For a baby taken via taxi or Uber to doctor's appointments, the car seat should ideally have the LATCH system integrated into the car seat.

I've settled on the [Nuna Urbn Flex system](https://nunababy.com/usa/pipa-urbn-flex-system?color_ref=16366) as my preferred car seat, because it has the LATCH system built into the car seat and since Nuna makes generally safe and comfortable car seat. The Nuna Urbn must be purchased as part of a bundle (along with a stroller), which is why I didn't initially find it when I was looking for a baby car seat.

The [Joie Mint Latch](https://joiebaby.com/us/mint-latch-integrated-rigid-latch#color=683) has been recommended to me for similar reasons.

### Belt routing
If you can't get a car seat with an integrated LATCH system in the seat, be aware of belt routing options. Belt routing refers to the path that the seatbelt takes around the car seat to secure it.

"European belt routing" refers to when the seat belt goes behind (from the baby's perspective) the car seat, which is generally safer in the event of a crash. The alternative (I assume "American belt routing") is that the seat belt exclusively over the lap of the infant. I picked the [Nuna Pipa rx + Pipa Relx Base](https://nunababy.com/usa/pipa-rx-infant-car-seat-with-relx-base) for this reason (partially because I wasn't aware of the Nuna Urbn).

### Weight and Size
For an infant car seat, favor a lighter seat, so that you can secure your baby into the car seat before putting the car seat into the car. Installing a newborn into a car seat is hard enough, so don't over complicate it by having to contort to fit into the backseat of the car at the same time.

With the same thinking, look for a car seat that attaches to a stroller, instead of car seat that converts into a stroller. That's bulk (both weight and size) that you don't want to be lifting into the car at the same time as you are trying to put your baby in.

When your child outgrows the infant car seat, the car seats will require being installed first. At this point, I think a heavier convertable car seat is fine.

When flying, you'll go back to wanting the lightest car seat available, since you will be carrying it. The [Cosco Kids Scenera from Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/CK-SCENERA-CC-SIP-NT/9321554473) is a perfectly fine choice.

## Stroller
The car seat will inform one of the strollers that you should pick. If you bought the Nuna Urbn bundle, part of the stroller decision making is already done for you.

Most stroller brands are interoperateable with car seats from other brands when used with the right adapters, but double-check the attachment compatability before you buy.

As your baby grows, the stroller requirements are going to change. My baby was born in the winter, so she only went outside to go to the neighborhood peadatrician in an Uber. Now that she's older and the weather is warmer, we walk almost everywhere with her, using the stroller as a cargo carrier.

### Weight, Suspension and Folded Carrying
A light weight stroller is easier to lift, but a heavy stroller provides a more comfortable ride for your baby.

For picking a "light" stroller, try picking it up once folded. In my experience, that's when a stroller is most difficult to carry, and when weight becomes most apparent. To make an analogy, the folded stroller works like a kettlebell, trying to pull you out of balance.

However, a heavy stroller will have more inertia, and therefore be a more comfortable ride. The suspension seems to work better when the stroller has more mass.

We started with a 17lb travel stroller, which worked great for carrying it up and down the stairs in our walk-up apartment. But when we went outside of our immediate area, it became very clear that the stroller's suspension as insufficient for the state the of the sidewalks we were walking over. And when we moved to an elevator building, we mostly stopped using the lightweight stroller.

### Folding mechanism
One-handed, three-part folding is amazing. Being able to hold your child with 1 hand, and fold the stroller with another, is great. But to make that truely work, you need the stroller to fold into thirds, so that the stroller handle is still in the air (ie, you don't have to bend to the ground to complete the fold). 

Two-part folder kinda sucks, especially if it needs two hands to do so. A stroller like this will basically assume that you live in an elevator building, and don't fold your stroller.

### Size
I recommend having a double stroller, even for one child, provided the seats are arranged in-line with the direction of the stroller (as opposed to having the seats side-by-side). The reason why is adding attachments for the baby car seat, so that the car seat is attached to the stroller while the baby is sitting comfortably in the main seat. The handful of times where we did this, it was super helpful (although, it also looks extremely goofy).

### Attachments and Cup Holders
I recommend buying a bunch of attachments for the stroller, especially cupholders. It sounds absurd, but 3 cupholders is the minimum that I would recommend. Every cupholder or stroller carry-all that you add will get filled up with stuff. Before you know it, you have 5 cups holders and you're still stuck carrying a coffee cup with one hand.

Importantly, cargo capacity is a big factor in using a stroller. Our Vista is basically always full of empty tote bags, extra blankets and a baby carrier. It's the shopping cart when walking home from the grocery store. A bigger cargo capacity is better.

The Uppababy bassinet I purchased was a waste - we exclusively used it to hold a changing pad in our apartment. It didn't feel safe to take our baby near any roads or hills in that bassinet, since she wasn't secured in it. It's such a shame, because it felt like such a good idea, despite people telling us that we'd never use the bassinet.

### What I Bought
I settled on buying an Uppababy stroller early in my search. I had seriously considered Bugaboo strollers - my family had at the time access to a discount on Bugaboo strollers, but I wasn't particularly impression by the wheel locking mechanism or the suspension on their 5 year old stroller (arguably this would not have been issues with a modern Bugaboo). I generally didn't like the folding mechanisms on Nuna strollers. Since I knew we would use the stroller a lot in New York, cost savings from a cheaper stroller didn't feel worth the lesser features. I see a lot of Uppababy strollers around me, and I've seen Uppababy strollers survive, so it felt really easy to decide on Uppababy.

I recommend the [Uppababy Minu](https://uppababy.com/strollers/lightweight/minu-v3/) and the [Uppababy Vista](https://uppababy.com/strollers/full-size/vista-v3/). Based on my research, it seems like all of the major stroller companies have strollers in these categories, so even if I picked Uppababy strollers, the reason for why I picked these strollers should carry over to other brands. These strollers also cover both extremes for our needs, so we have the right stroller for what we're going to do.

The Minu is basically the best travel stroller. It's light, and has a one-handed, three-part fold. If the suspension was better and the cargo capacity was bigger, I would have been tempted to not buying another stroller. The downside of the Minu is that it does not support the Rumble seat of the Vista and Cruz, so the seat is built for an older infant.

The Vista is perfect as long as you don't need to fold it or lift it up. The suspension is good, but cargo capacity is phenominal. The seating is great, and it's large enough that we could attach the car seat as an extra seat. Our Vista almost never gets folded up, and rarely gets emptied, which is a consideration for apartment space. If it does get folded, it's exclusively my job to lift and move it.

The Uppababy Cruz was a contentor - it's the one-child only variant of the Vista. The newest Cruz adds extra lay-flat features that might replace the Uppababy bassinet, in which case the Cruz is the cheaper version of a one-baby Vista. Given that we wanted something that could also carry the car seat, it didn't make sense for us to buy the Cruz.

I did not consider the Uppababy Ridge, since neither my wife nor I jog or run. I understood the Uppababy G Luxe as a 0.4 lb lighter competitor to the Minu, but without the ability to attach car seats. It would have looked weird to have only 1 baby in the Minu Duo, which is a 2-seater stroller.

Uppababy does not make a wagon stroller, but for an toddler who can sit up, a wagon has even more capacity than the Uppababy Vista.

## Feeding
### Formula
If you have a formula-fed baby, you must [mix the formula by boiling water, letting that cool to 70C, then mixing the formula powder, and then letting that cool to 40C before baby can drink it](https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/formula-feeding/preparation-and-storage.html) ([The FDA gives different advice on proper formula mixing](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/handling-infant-formula-safely-what-you-need-know)). This has to be done to kill Cronobacter spores that might be dangerous to your newborn. Getting an electric kettle speeds up one part of this process. Get any electric kettle - this is your opportunity to buy that EKG Stagg kettle that you've always wanted.

[Mason jar pitchers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D25RRRKY) were the perfect solution for pre-mixing formula.

If you formula feed, buy the [Baby Brezza Baby Formula Dispenser](https://babybrezza.com/products/formula-pro-advanced-wifi-baby-formula-dispenser): if you have a formula-fed baby, and if your baby is old enough to have the stomach acids that allows them to skip the sterilization-mixing process, a formula dispenser is a god-send. It makes baby bottles almost instantly, and if you have the discipline to put in a new bottle when taking the filled one out, the wifi enabled model lets you fill a bottle as you're walking across the apartment.

If you formula-feed, keeping your formula-making area clean will be an important concern. Take a look at a bottle washer to keep everything as clean as possible.

### Bottles
I like the [Pigeon Bottles](https://www.pigeonstore.com/products/ppsu-wide-neck-baby-bottle-2), but my recommendation is to just buy lots and lots of different brands of bottles, and then use whichever one works.

"Anti-colic" features on bottles are basically a lie - doctors (source, The Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr Harvey Karp, see below) will say that the research says that colic has nothing to do with babies getting air into their stomaches while drinking milk or formula. Anti-colic features do help a baby drink from a bottle, but they do so via allowing air in via a route other than the center of the nipple. Anti-colic features also often take the form of straws or tubes inside the bottle - these are very annoying to clean, and the nipple collapses more easily if the full system isn't being used. I strongly prefer to avoid those bottle entirely if possible.

I found that holding baby semi-upright was necessary to minimize spit-up, at which point, it was sufficient for the bottle to have a side hole for air to enter the bottle.

Additionally, the recommendation was to prefer a slower-flowing nipple, and to only upgrade nipple sizes when it was becoming apparent that a bigger flow was necessary. Lot's of smaller bottles over the day was better than fewer big bottles.

Buy a bottle washer, not a sterilizer, like the [Baby Brezza Bottle Washer Pro](https://babybrezza.com/products/bottle-washer-pro). I bought a sterilizer, and did not know that the bottler washer existed until my baby's bottle could just go in the dish washer. You will be washing bottles multiple times per day, so having a separate appliance, where you can just leave clean bottles in them, is fully worth the cost. With the sterilizer, the bottle must be washed first, which means hand washed given the frequency at which bottles need to be cleaned. You could stick to using a dish washer with the sanitize setting, or not bothering, but the piece of mind from having clean and sterilized bottles is worth the cost. 

## Other
### Changing Pads and Diapers
* Changing pad for on-the-go: [Skip Hop Changing Pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WDDBLM?th=1) - no padding, but can carry daipers, wipes and creams.
* At home changing pads - I've have not found the perfect changing pad, but the least bad one is [Keekaroo Peanut Changer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KSW970Y).
  * I want one that gets attached to the table, and those don't seem to exist. Instead you can choose between if the strap is attached to the table or attached to the changing pad. If the strap is attached to the changing pad, baby can try to flip the changing pad off the table or drawer that it's on (which is not okay). If the strap is attached to the table, the changing pad will shift under the strap, which is slightly better, but still suboptimal.
  * You will be choosing between having a soft changing pad or having one that's easy to clean
* [Diaper Genie](https://diapergenie.com/products/diaper-genie-complete-pail) - make sure to have a self-closing lid on the diaper pail
* [Costco Huggies+](https://www.costco.com/p/-/huggies-plus-diapers-size-newborn/4000222596?langId=-1) - Costco seems to have the extra absorbant version of Huggies diapers

The diaper bag turned out to be unimportant - any backpack will do.
 
### Crib
[Cribs are regulated](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-B/part-1219). Read up on the latest safety standards for cribs (which surprisingly get updated periodically), and then buy a crib accordingly. The details that matter and general form factor is the same because of regulations.

I bought the [Nestig Wave Crib](https://www.nestig.com/products/the-wave-crib), and it has been great for expandability as my baby grew.

Try renting a [SNOO Smart Sleeper](https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-rental). It's a smart crib that automatically shushes and rocks your baby, but requires that your baby is swaddled using their sleep sacks. It worked great for our baby, but not all babies love it in the same way. Therefore, rent instead of buy, and have a mini-crib ready if your baby hates the SNOO. The SNOO is based on the ideas in [The Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr Harvey Karp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553393235), and reading the book was helpful.

### Pack and Play
For traveling, the [Guava Family Travel Crib](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AKKDSNG) ended up being the best, portable, semi-comfortable solution for a pack-and-play.

For home, we use the [Uppababy Remi](https://uppababy.com/at-home/playard/remi/) as a pack-and-play. The mattress is breathable, the pack-and-play is adjustable as baby grows, but it's also heavier and harder to travel with.

We ended up being very unclear on how safe pack-and-plays are for sleep. Some (but not all) are rated for sleep, and it's entirely possible that there are extra considerations that we didn't learn about.

### High Chair
Buy the [Stokke Tripp Trapp](https://www.stokke.com/USA/en-us/high-chairs/tripp-trapp/TT03.html) with the newborn high chair attachment. The newborn high chair attachment was perfect for when the baby needed to be watched while cooking. I grew up with a Tripp Trapp, and it is adaptable as the kids grow.

My research said that a baby sleeping in a bouncer is a SIDS risk, and that the bouncer was generally unnecessary. If you get a baby bouncer, make sure that they are always supervised in it.

### Baby carrier
My wife likes the [Tula Explore Baby Carrier](https://babytula.com/collections/explore-baby-carrier). We ended up trying many different baby carriers, and it seems like baby needs to pick the baby carrier that she prefers most.

### Toys
I subscribed to baby toy subscriptions from [Kiwi Co Panda Crate](https://www.kiwico.com/panda) and [Lovevery Play Kits](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker), which seems to have been a good idea. The toys are generally developmentally appropriate, where a newborn goes through several key stages of pay as they start discovering the world around them.

A lot of "classic" baby toys are actually for toddlers, so a lot of the toys that you get gifted will probably end up in a closet.

### Baby Monitor
I bought the [Nanit Pro Baby Monitor](https://www.nanit.com/products/nanit-pro-camera). Our use case was that Dad, Mom and Grandma all needed to be able to monitor the sleeping baby, and a WiFi-enabled smart monitor send data to phone apps allowed that to happen. The Nanit app does a really good job of summarizing baby's sleep. The con is that anyone with access would be able to watch and hear the sleeping baby, and when baby is sleeping in your bedroom, that includes hearing you too.

Relatedly, the [Nanit Glo Sound Machine](https://www.nanit.com/products/nanit-sound-light) was a great investment - it can double as an audio-only baby monitor (apparently, because I haven't tried it), but more importantly, you can adjust the volume via the Nanit app. I prefer automating the sound machine and the lights, because that's on thing that you as the parent should need to think about every bed time.

I never managed to get the [Owlet Dream Sock](https://owletcare.com/products/owlet-dream-sock) to work on on our home WiFi. In theory, it's a great way to keep track of how your baby is sleeping. On the other hand, I've anecdotally heard that getting too much data about how the baby is sleeping is anxiety inducing, since there's only so much a parent can do to optimize their baby's sleep. I'd recommend skipping it.

The alternative is to get a local-only RF baby monitor, which can be audio-only or also do video. They are harder to hack, since the hacker needs to be in your neighborhood, but you also can't check in on if the babysitter put the baby to sleep during date night. I bought the [VTech DM221-2 Audio Baby Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007NG5UEU) as a back-up baby monitor when my baby was transitioning into her own room (especially when she'd nap in there, but sleep overnight in our room), but they are entirely unused right now. 

### Pacifiers
Buy lots and lots of pacifiers until you find what your baby likes. My baby loves her [Bibs pacifiers](https://us.bibsworld.com/collections/pacifiers-size-1).

The silicone pacifiers are generally better, because the natural rubber (latex) ones need to be periodically replaced as they break down. However, the natural rubber ones clearly give a better chew/squeeze that our baby prefers much more strongly.

### Baby clothes
As the dad, I focused on buying clothing staples, and encouraged family to buy outfits. People have a lot more fun buying cute little outfits for your baby, so if you encourage outfit shopping, you're much more likely to get baby clothes gifted to you.

For generic staples like bodysuits, pants, and pajamas, you can stock up ahead. You don't know when your baby will need a give size (so don't preemptively buy holiday-specific outfits too early), but eventually they will grow into that size.

For daywear, I recommend stocking up on sweatpants, footed pants, and bodysuits (in long and short sleeves) made of cotton. Babies spit up on or spill on their bodysuits all day, so you will plan on them changing clothes multiple times per day. However, they also they don't wear any given item that many times before they outgrow them, and so buying lots of cheaper cotton items is totally fine.

Socks are a good idea in cold weather, but my baby did not like her socks when it was warm outside.

For pajamas, bamboo rayon or bamboo viscose seems to be the best material for one-piece, double-zipper pajama. My research says that bamboo does a better job at keeping a baby comfortable in hot and cold. Patterned pajamas are better for checking a video baby monitor to see if they are breathing. Double-zipper is much easier to undo when you need to change a baby in the middle of the night, and you don't want to completely remove their pajamas first.

I don't have a recommended brand at the moment. [Honest Baby Clothing](https://honestbabyclothing.com) was my preferred brand for cheap, soft, cotton bodysuits, but they are apparently stopping their online shop (or exiting the clothing business, or doing some other radical change, it's very unclear).
